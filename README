= tinc public key db for the InterCityVPN =

Also see: http://wiki.freifunk.net/IC-VPN

The InterCityVPN is a network inter connecting various cities'
open mesh networks via tinc and Quagga-BGP.

This repository gathers various tinc public keys usable
for peering as well as according signatures. The goal is to
be able to update peerings in an automized fashion.

To be able to do this in a secure way you are advised to add
your tinc public keys with a gpg signature next to it as there
might be users having write access to this repository who you do not
know/trust.


= TODOs =

Which format for the signatures? We should probably agree on
something to make it easy for scripts to find signature files
belonging to a certain tinc public key.

Every signature should be stored in a separate file to avoid
merge conflicts.

For instance: [tinc-hostname].sig for the owner's signature,
and [tinc-hostname-A]->[tinc-hostname-B].sig for A's signature of B's
tinc public key?

Or better building the web-of-trust via gpg key signatures
instead of file signatures?
